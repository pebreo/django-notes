Overview
--------
Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 is a service
that let's you store and serve static files.


CREATING A BUCKET
---------------
Buckets let you organize how you store your files.
To create a bucket you should do the following:
1. Create the bucket
2. Set the policy for the bucket
3. Test using python boto

HOW DJANGO S3 STORAGE WORKS
---------------------------
In Django, you can customize where your static files
will be dumped when you run the `collectstatic` command.

The general steps to setup Django to static files to S3 are:
1. Open a root account
2. Create a bucket where your static files will go
3. Create a user account
3b. Add appropriate permissions to user account
4. Add policy to the bucket (see public permissions policy below)
5. Get user account credentials
6. Put `django_s3_storage` in `INSTALLED_APPS`
7. Change `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` to `"django_s3_storage.storage.S3Storage"`
8. Change `STATICFILES_STORAGE` to `"django_s3_storage.storage.StaticS3Storage"`
9. Put user account credentials in `s3_settings.py` 

Also, don't forget to `pip install django-s3-storage`.

#### Policy to allow public permissions for static files
If you want to use that bucket as a static server then you need to add this as the policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2016-12-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aws-s3-firstbucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
